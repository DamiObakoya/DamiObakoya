Hi, I’m Dami Obakoya. I’m a Computer Science major and student-athlete with a strong interest in software development. I enjoy building projects that solve real problems and help me grow my technical skills. I’m currently focused on improving my coding, learning new technologies, and gaining real-world experience.

Skills

Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, SQL
Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
Concepts: Problem solving, data analysis, databases

Athlete Training Tracker
A text-based Python program that lets athletes track their training sessions and view basic statistics. Users can add sessions, view all workouts, calculate total and average training time, and delete entries. This project helped me practice Python programming, working with JSON files for data storage, and building a simple but functional application that handles real-world tasks.

Packing List Organizer
A Python program that helps users manage a packing list. Users can add and remove items, view the current list, and mark items as packed. This project helped me practice Python programming, working with lists and tuples, and building interactive command-line applications that solve everyday problems.
